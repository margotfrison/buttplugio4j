# Contributing

Thank you for contributing to the ButtplugIO4J Library !

Here are some sort guideline for opening issues and write them well to help us
(therefore yourself) to resolve the issue.

## I don't know anything about this library

I'm an user that used an app or mod or plugin that supposedly used this library.

I can open an issue with general questions, or better a bug report. I should be as precise
as possible and add to the issue my OS and its version, the app/mod/plugin that I use.

I know that the developers that contribute to this library will use their patience and their
will to help me, but I also understand that their may or may not be at fault for my issue.

## I'm a developer who uses this library but I started developing myself recently or for fun

I can open an issue with general questions or help or a bug report. I should be as precise
as possible and add to the issue my OS and its version I develop on and if possible a concise
piece of code that you think is related to the issue.

I know that the developers that contribute to this library will help me at best at possible
without mocking my skill level no matter how low, but I also understand that the developer's
time is limited and I should not be impatient.

## I'm a developer who uses this library and I know what I'm doing or I have experience

I can open an issue with general questions or help or a bug report. I throw anything that I
think is relevant to solve the issue, or even better, I write a pull request !

I know that my expertise is listened and welcome and that the discussion will be courteous,
but I also understand that the developers that contribute to this project also deserve the same
level of respect.

## I wish to contribute to this project with my free time

I can open an issue to discuss about a bug or enhancement I would like to see fixed or developed.
I understand that it is best to discuss features with other contributors before writing any code
as my request could be not suited for this project or just a bad idea.

I know that my wish to give my free time to contribute to this project is appreciated and that
other contributors will discuss my ideas respectfully, but I also understand that, like me, other
contributors work on this project on their free time and will be (respectfully !) objective and
critical of my work, as they also have their own vision.

We as contributors should seek a consensus, not an ego war or a vote to majority. We should
discuss with only objectivity and facts as long as needed to reach this consensus.
